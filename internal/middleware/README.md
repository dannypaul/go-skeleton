## Request Id middleware

Generally it is difficult to correlate the logs generated by a request.

The idea of the X-Request-ID header is that a client can create some random ID and pass it to the server. The server then include that ID in every log statement that it creates. If a client receives an error it can include the ID in a bug report, allowing the server operator to look up the corresponding log statements.
